Figure out how to calculate)\r\n* To-Do:\tIf entering afternoon (last punch) in a row, make it PM if it looks like it should be\r\n* Times with seconds can now be entered without punctuation (e.g. 12:22:46 can be entered as 122246 and will format correctly)\r\n* Times entered in OUT column are assumed to be PM and a final (night) punch\r\n\r\n\r\n**v6.4 RC (released 1/7/2013)**\r\n* Added prompt on PeopleSoft Importer notifying user that it's currently broken\r\n\r\n**v6.3 RC (released 12/10/2012)**\r\n* Adjusted Clear Times sub to remove comments, which could incorrectly report previously imported PeopleSoft times\r\n* Re-wrote adding code, which is all done in the background and doesn't use (breakable) sheet formulas\r\n* Slightly revised Clear Times sub to run faster and with less screen flicker\r\n\r\n**v6.2 RC (released 05/29/2012)**\r\n* Added \"working\" form to Clear Times button\r\n* Fixed bug where some subs wouldn't heed command to not show application alerts, which resulted in user confusion\r\n* Hidden working sub now included, which will eventually process PeopleSoft HTML code for timesheet import\r\n* After clearing times on main page, active cell now returns to Monday's first punch \r\n\r\n**v6.2 beta (released 02/10/2012)**\r\n* Revised pre-populated list of names/emails for emailling times based on staff turnover\r\n* Fixed bug in Email sub that halted when no Outlook signature file existed (based on font and font size)\r\n* Fixed bug in VBA references when running on older versions of Office (removed superfluous references)\r\n* Added error catching code in Email sub, prompting with a more descriptive (and user-friendly) error message\r\n\r\n**v6.1 beta (released 11/03/2011)**\r\n* Fixed Bug: Importing from PeopleSoft was not possible when using any browser other than Chrome\r\n* Fixed Bug: Various input revision bugs when inputting directly to sheet (not using military time)\r\n* Fixed: (v.6) New Bug: adding an OUT time should check to see if it's after the IN time, and adjust to military accordingly (e.g. 5-->1700)\r\n* Fixed Bug: Inputting times directly to sheet using two digits over 24 rolls over to future days (fix: disallow and blank >24 inputs)\r\n* Added: highlight (faint) those times that were either new or confirmed with PeopleSoft imports (cleared as well). Should retain between edits.\r\n* Fixed Bug: adding/deleting additional names and emails inside email times routine is now more robust\r\n* Added: when running PeopleSoft importer, now checks for open window with timesheet. If not, prompts to open timesheet URL\r\n* Fixed: (v.6) New Bug: Highlighting times in email script does not work, sometimes highlights header values\r\n* New Bug: Too much screen flicker (probably because of poorly-placed Application.ScreenUpdating commands)\r\n\r\n**v6.0 beta (released 10/24/2011)**\r\n* Beta release of PeopleSoft importer\r\n* Allows inputting of times in sheet in military time without : seperator (e.g., 1300, 13, 13:00, 13.00 all convert to 1:00:00 PM)\r\n* Beta release of button to email times to someone\r\n* New Bug: Midnight times are not converted correctly if : seperator is not used (fix: look for hrs>24)\r\n* New Bug: Highlighting times in email script does not work, sometimes highlights header values\r\n* New Bug: adding an OUT time should check to see if it's after the IN time, and adjust to military accordingly (e.g. 5-->1700)\r\n* Fixed Bug: selecting multiple options in user prefs now disallowed; part time employees added, new comp time forumla in sheet\r\n\r\n**v5.0 (released 8/15/2011)**  \r\n* Updated example sheet to reflect new planner\r\n* Added button on main sheet to clear previous times (uses macro)\r\n\r\n**v4.0 (released 4/29/2011)**  \r\n* Began changelog\r\n* Fixed bug that could prevent Friday punch helper from appearing\r\n* Added formula in Friday punch helper that will make automatic 1-hour lunch more obvious to user\r\n* Added time code for holiday hours\r\n* Fixed bug that could incorrectly report the number of incorrect or missing timecodes for time off\r\n\r\n========\r\n\r\n### Task list for future development\r\n\r\n* Test and refine PeopleSoft importer\r\n* PS Importer currently discards (ignores) time off values\r\n* Update conflict resolution to include ability to move punches (for missing IN PS punches)\r\n* Decrease number of prompts to user; become more autonomous\r\n* Eventually fully automate calculations, instead of using hidden cells\r\n* Re-work design and layout to be easier to understand (less big blocks of text)\r\n* Adjust last-punch calculator to be VBA, include all contingencies and proper trigger for showing\r\n* Make auto-round of PeopleSoft times a user-selectable option (default rounded)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-41248128-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
